# Recipes search engine

OpenClassrooms project

## Link to the website

[Les Petits Plats - recipes search engine](https://dimterion.github.io/Recipes-search-engine/)

## Built with

HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

## Task

- Build a webpage with a list of recipes and a search functionality
- Use provided mockups, specifications and design: [Webpage example](https://www.figma.com/file/bcU7zyhMTJM26j50pm9EKx/UI-Design-Les-Petits-Plats-EN)
- Create a search functionality with a search input field and three groups of tags
- Input field and tags should work both separately and in the combination with each other
- Add recipes from the separate JavaScript array
- Implement two possible solutions for the search engine: one using native loops (for, while, etc.) and another one using array class methods (forEach, filter, map, etc.)
- Create a dedicated GitHub branch for each of the implementations
- Test performance for each of the implementations and analyse them
- Compare the implementations and fill in a Functionality Investigation Form with the description of each of them, flow-charts describing the mechanic of the search in each case and recommendations on which one is more effective: [Functionality Investigation Form](https://github.com/Dimterion/Recipes-search-engine/blob/main/assets/Functionality%20Investigation%20Form.pdf)

## Project goals

- Deconstruct a computational problem
- Develop an algorithm to solve a problem
